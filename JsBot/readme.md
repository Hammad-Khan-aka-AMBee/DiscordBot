* v1.2.0 was built with DJS_v12 with major changes in python and JS in 2020 and 2021 (Reddit API, newspaper using pupeeteer)
* v1.2.1 was built with DJS_v12 with major changes in features (Introductons, XP, Currency, Tags and some NSFW commands) in 2021. Most of them have been deleted so I made v_1.3, though i recovered some original but not all like utility commands
* v1.3.0 was built using DJS_v14 with major changes in DJS API but were not adopted as work was restarted after 2 years in 2023. Some major changes in features were revised since last ones were lost (XP, Currency) and old framework was made better for collaborators. Github was officially introduced for the bot. Usually it is officially v1.3.1 but since old work was lost.
* v1.3.1 was made using DJS_v14 with major changes in old commands but new features were introduced (help, Card Game, IoT modules using MQTT, pygame, AI integration using scikit learn). This was done in Aug 2023 to Oct 2023. Website was introduced for FYP project and Bot documentation on Gitbook.  
* v2.0 is in the making now with changes in UI and functionality. This has started in Jan 2024.
# Version Control Format
Version control is made to facilitate major changes done at Server_bot UI, Bot's functionality, Bot's Feature update. vx shows UI changes, vx.x shows functionality enhancement and vx.x.x shows new major feature update. Performance and security is not included in version control since these are necessity and not updates for premium.
